# 10: The playoff header takes three lines on a tablet

**What to build:** A league member on a tablet sees the "Playoff %" header of the rankings table on two lines at most, as on a phone and a desktop. At 768 the 40px column and the 11px label put it on three lines: "PLAY-", "OFF", "%". The soft hyphen in the header is on purpose. A 44px playoff column fixes it but leaves the team track 1.5px over the width the longest name needs. Find a header text or a column width that holds at every tier. The type scale of the report feature made the label bigger on a tablet, so this is from before the site-pages feature.
