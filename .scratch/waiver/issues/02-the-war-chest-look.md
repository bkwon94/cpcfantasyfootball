# 02: The War chest look

Spec: `.scratch/waiver/PRD.md` in the pipeline repo. The look is option D in
`.superpowers/brainstorm/` there, `look-faab.html`.

**What to build:** The waiver page is a black card. Under the masthead sits the budget ring: twelve
avatars with a bar each in budget order. Under the ring, five tabs, one per bucket. Under the tabs, the
drift field: the top 6 of the open bucket as headshots that drift in slow motion, sized by rank, each
with its price. Under the field, the sheet: the open player's name, his three facts, his research
claims with source links, the bid to win, the last like him, and a line that the experts are missing
when the flag says so. Under the sheet, the list of the whole bucket in order. A tap on a headshot or a
list row fills the sheet. The sheet keeps its player when the tab changes. The drift stops under
reduced motion and when the tab is hidden. At 390 pixels no headshot covers another.

The positions in the field are a fixed layout per rank, never random. New sizes and colors go in the
global stylesheet as tokens. Motion goes through the one reduced-motion switch.

**Blocked by:** 01 The route behind the flag.
